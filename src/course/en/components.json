However, as a rule of thumb, 10% of the word count is a useful guide. So, for a 20-credit module with a 4000-word count assignment, the bibliography would be approximately 40 references. It is important to reference sources of literature in your work to support the claims you are making. Having a suitable number of references demonstrates you have read widely around the subject. If you look at your assessment criteria, you will typically gain higher marks if you read more widely and incorporate this reading through referenced content. As a balance though, it is also important to allow your own voice to be heard through your work. It is considered poor academic practice to include lots of quotes in an assignment. A well-placed quote here or there is fine but overdoing it prevents your own words and your own (informed) opinions from shining through.</p>",
